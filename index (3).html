        <strong>Our Mission</strong><br>
        At Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation, our mission is to provide quality education to children in slum areas by breaking barriers to access and opportunity. We aim to create a nurturing and inclusive learning environment where every child can thrive, grow, and realize their full potential. Through innovative teaching, community involvement, and strategic partnerships, we are committed to bridging the educational gap and fostering sustainable, long-term change.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Our Story</strong><br>
        Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation began with a simple idea: to empower slum children through education. Inspired by her own experiences and driven by a passion for social justice, Sunita founded the organization under the Indian Societies Act of 1860. With the help of like-minded individuals, what started as a small initiative has grown into a powerful movement transforming countless lives. From humble beginnings to becoming a symbol of hope, our journey reflects resilience, compassion, and a shared belief that every child deserves a chance to learn and succeed.
